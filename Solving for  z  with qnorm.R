z <- qnorm(0.995)    # calculate z to solve for 99% confidence interval
pnorm(qnorm(0.995))    # demonstrating that qnorm gives the z value for a given probability
pnorm(qnorm(1-0.995))    # demonstrating symmetry of 1-qnorm
pnorm(z) - pnorm(-z)    # demonstrating that this z value gives correct probability for interval
